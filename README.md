## How LinguaDoc works
By clicking on the Text Translation, users are taken to a page where they can input the API key required for initializing the BasicLingua library . This key is essential for accessing and utilizing the library's feature of Text Translation. Upon accessing the page, users are prompted to obtain an API key from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for the initialization of the BasicLingua library.

## Installation
The application has been bundled into a setup file, allowing you to install and run it locally without needing to have Python installed on your machine. This ensures that our non-coder friends can also use the application with ease.

You can download the setup file from the following link:
